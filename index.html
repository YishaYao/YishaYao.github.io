I obtained my PhD from the <a href="https://statistics.rutgers.edu">Department of Statistics at Rutgers University< a>, 
advised by Professor <a href="https://statweb.rutgers.edu/cunhui/">Cun-Hui Zhang< a>
Currently I am a postdoc at Yale University, working with Professor <a href="https://ysph.yale.edu/profile/heping-zhang/">Heping Zhang</a>. 
Prior to US, I was an undergraduate at Peking University studying statistics and biomedical sciences (double majors).

My research interests fall within a wide spectrum of high-dimensional statistics inlucding but not limited to 
compressed sensing, sparse phase retrieval, nonparametric models, statistical inferences, algorithms for high-dimensional problems.  
I am also bridging statistical methodology/theory with biomedical sciences (genetics, epigenetics, neuroscience, cancer research, etc), 
applied mathematics (representation theory), and deep learning.
